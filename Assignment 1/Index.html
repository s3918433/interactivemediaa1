        <h3>“What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?’’</h3>
        <p>The scribbled animated abstract lines that go across the webpage caught my attention, as they are the first thing you'll see when viewing the page. It makes you wait for it to finish drawing, curious about what they are scribbling and what they are making. It will then lead you to the introduction page, where it automatically animated the big word ‘Sculpting Harmony', which is designed for users to be ‘attracted’ to it. That way, it leads them to hover their mouse over or even click on it as they want to know ‘what does it do’. Otherwise, the stretch animation makes you want to scroll down and see what’s to come. </p>

        <h3>“What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?’’</h3>
        <p>Most of the mediums that i spend time engaging on are the 3D models, the background effect, the ‘Sculpting Harmony’ section, the music and the videos.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            3D models: The designers have posted 3D models of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which I think are quite entertaining and appealing to play with. It contains both the model's sketches and the finale. I liked how I could view the models in 360 degrees, including zooming in to see the details and out to appreciate the product from a broader viewpoint.

          </li>
          <li>
            The background effect: the background that animates the screen whenever I scroll down is the interactive experience that I spend the most time with. It animates the screen every time I scroll down, as if I were seeing the building from a drone at my own pace. I find it incredibly satisfying to play with because I am constantly switching back and forth to see how it flows neatly over my screen. 
          </li>
          <li>
            ‘Sculpting Harmony’: The designers created this area so that when users hover their mouse, it generates a word that leads to their story and appears dependent on how they move their mouse. I think it is extremely creative and artistic since it is another method to convey a narrative. I spend more time reading the story and toying with the result. I enjoy playing with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Music: I've spent more time admiring the music while lazily scrolling over the site. The music that the designers included on the website made the experience more immersive as if you were in the concert hall itself. It gave the website a feel that conveys to the user what type of performance hall they are.
          </li>
          <li>
            Videos: I spent more time viewing the interview video than reading the website's paragraph material. Because I am not the type of person who enjoys reading, I will spend more time learning while viewing the documentary. Furthermore, I find the subtitles appealing to look at while watching the interview; their opacity increases while the interviewee speaks in the video, as opposed to a standard subtitle, which has no effects.

          <h3>“What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?’’
          </h3>
          <p>In my two minutes, the most common action is to toy around with the interactive parts from the website; The background effect and the ‘Sculpturing Harmony’ section. I find both mediums to be incredibly entertaining and satisfying to play with. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The background effect: The captivating background effect, which features the Walt Disney Concert Hall building that resembles drone footage, is the medium I played the most than the ‘Sculptering Harmony’ effect. As I scroll down, the background moves, simulating drone-like movement, and when I scroll up, the background seems to rewind, creating a unique and immersive browsing experience. I spend a lot of time on this part because I enjoy experimenting with the animation; it's fun to play with.

            </li>
            <li>
              ‘Sculpturing Harmony’ section: This section drew my attention right away, and I spent the majority of my two-minute interactive experience playing in it. When I hover the mouse over the large font, the words appear as I move, creating a story. I read the brief paragraphs and toyed with the effect; I like how they appear when I move the mouse.

           answer 
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <span class="question">
          <h3>“How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?”</h3>
          <p>I believe the primary goal is to teach users about the historical building, not just how it was created but also about its context; why was the building built? Why is it known as the 'Walt Disney Concert Hall'? Why was it built in a certain way? What kind of music do they play in the concert hall? Etc. The designers successfully communicated these goals without having to design in a traditional form, instead using interactive media such as 3D models, films, and music.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              3D: The use of 3D models allows designers to portray the building from a variety of angles and perspectives, which is very useful for international visitors or those who have never seen it. By zooming in and out, viewers may have a more immersive and detailed perspective of the building, giving them a better sense of how it looks. This successfully communicated the primary purpose by improving their users' visualisations, demonstrating a more detailed and immersive representation of the subject than typical 2D images.
            </li>
            <li>
              Video: The use of video showcased a taped interview with architect Frank Gehry. He was asked questions about the music hall's development process and explained why he chose certain features for the hall. Not only is this an enjoyable way to learn about the building, but it also allows viewers to connect with him. Understand the deeper meaning of why he designed the structure in that way. It appears that they saw this building as art, which is why the filmed video revealed the deeper meaning of why they built it that way.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sound: When visitors enter the webpage, they will be greeted by music. The classical music that replays and changes as you scroll down to the next chapters reveals what kind of music was played in the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This medium may enhance the interactive experience by allowing users to be 'in the mood' or experience nostalgia, as classical music frequently conveys a feeling of history. With this medium included in the website, the designers have successfully communicated their primary objectives.

        <span class="question">
          <h3>“What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?” (For how long and how many different times?)</h3>
          <p>After playing around with the website for a while, I find myself skipping past the informative sections; paragraphs, and videos. I ended up jumping to the interactive section that I enjoy; the 'Sculpturing Harmony' section, and the background effect. As someone who is not interested in architecture or structures, I find the website boring except for the interactive mediums; nonetheless, I do not read the text and instead play with it. This is my impression. In my view, users who visit the website for no reason may only visit once because there is nothing else to look at (just like me). For example, if you have already visited a museum, why should you return to the same museum with the same content? I believe that those who are interested in the building and want to learn more about it will find the interaction, such as the 3D models and interviewed videos, which can be useful for them and may return to it as a reference. 
          </p>

      <div class="container">
        <span class="question">
          <h3>"How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?''
          </h3>
          <p>The interactive medium is a very artistic and creative way of presenting information. The website does not display itself in a monotonous manner, as everything on this webpage can catch the users' attention. Visitors who have no intention of returning may skip the educational segment and instead play with the interactive parts until they become bored and leave. Again, it's similar to visiting a museum; why return when you've already seen the displays? </p>
          <p>However, users with specific purposes, such as UX designers, UI designers, architectural researchers, and architecture students, may return to the site. This is because the website contains many unique and interesting elements. For example, architecture students who want to examine the building in greater detail may use 3D models as a reference instead of a 2D image, allowing them to analyse the building from all angles. Users who work in UX/UI can visit the website for inspiration, to study how the website works, and to see how the designers uniquely presented their material; it can be used as a reference.

          <h3>“What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?’’ 
          </h3>
          <p>The animated abstract is the other media forms that experience reference. 
          </p>
          <p>The animated abstract that appears at the beginning of each chapter is the design of the building itself: the Walt Disney Concert Hall structure, the interior, and the organ. The fact that they are animated mimics how the architecture draws these sketches, which was a great addition to the experience.

          <h3>“What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?’’</h3>
          <p>This reference indicates that the webpage should be dealt with in a way that allows you to admire the art. It showed the entire process of building the concert hall, from sketches to the finished product. It tells a story. When viewing the website, users should interact with it as if it were a contemporary art museum; if you glare at or screen it quickly, you will think it is just a building; if you admire it, read it, and spend your time with it, it is more than that.
          </p>

      <div class="container">
        <span class="question">
          <h3>“What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?’’</h3>
          <p>As previously said, the web experience is similar to that of visiting a contemporary art gallery. Using museum terminology, the interviewed movies may be the videos that are presented in the museum, the 3D models are the three-dimensional artworks, the audio acts as background music that sets the ambience, similar to ambient sounds in museums, the photographs may serve as portraits, and the paragraphs may act as the piece's description.
          </p>
          <p>Users may experience feelings of amazement, inspiration, curiosity, and appreciation when viewing the website, much as they would in a museum. Capable of understanding why the building was made, designed the way it is, why it was built, and how much effort the architects put into the historical structure.
