              The scribbled animated abstract lines that go across the webpage
              caught my attention, as they are the first thing you'll see when
              viewing the page. It makes you wait for it to finish drawing,
              curious about what they are scribbling and what they are making.
              It will then lead you to the introduction page, where it
              automatically animated the big word ‘Sculpting Harmony', which is
              designed for users to be ‘attracted’ to it. That way, it leads
              them to hover their mouse over or even click on it as they want to
              know ‘what does it do’. Otherwise, the stretch animation makes you
              want to scroll down and see what’s to come.
